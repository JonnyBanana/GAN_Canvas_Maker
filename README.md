<b>Generating Art using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)</b>

</BR>

Python code to generate art with Generative Adversarial Network:

https://towardsdatascience.com/generating-modern-arts-using-generative-adversarial-network-gan-on-spell-39f67f83c7b4


</BR>

The code is made to run it on spell:

https://web.spell.ml/


</BR>


But it can also be launched locally, but obviously you need a good graphic card.

To launch the GAN locally you can use this command:

<b>python art_gan.py -m cubism_data.npy</b>


</BR>

The code I started from had a couple of indentation errors, and some unrecognized characters, which I fixed.

<b>Requirements:</b>

-tensorflow</BR>
-PIL</BR>
-os</BR>
-numpy</BR>
-spell</BR>

The repo also contains a small dataset (taken from wikiart) which contains 1000 images.

The complete dataset (25.4 Gb) can be downloaded from here:
